# Being on Time

From my college days, I had a habit of arriving 'just in time' for lectures. This behavior persisted as I transitioned into my professional career. People would occasionally hint that I should be more punctual, but I couldn't internalize the idea and never felt it was harming anyone. This pattern continued for years, unchanged, until Elchemy was born.

When I began attending meetings with external stakeholders (notably, very senior individuals), I observed them arriving well before the scheduled time. I felt embarrassed whenever I was late, whether for online or offline meetings. Over the past three years, as I interacted with numerous people - including customers, vendors, high-ranking officials, investors, and CXOs of public companies - I noticed one common trait among 90% of them: they were extremely punctual.

Gradually, I started making an effort to be on time for these 'external' meetings to avoid embarrassment. However, I still tended to be late for internal meetings. Occasionally, I would still arrive late to external meetings. It was then that I realized this trait had become ingrained in my personality, and I needed to start being punctual in all areas of my life to be consistently punctual in even one area - external meetings, internal meetings, and personal life. Recently, I've been reflecting on this and tried to articulate why being on time is crucial in life.

Here are several reasons I believe a lack of punctuality reflects poorly on an individual:

Here are a few reasons I think what lack of punctuality demonstrates about someone, personally:
- **It suggests a lack of discipline in life** - Consistently being late indicates an inability to manage oneself effectively
- **It indicates unreliability** - When you're late always, people learn they can't depend on you to be there when needed
- **It shows a disregard for other people's time** - Arriving late essentially communicates that you value your time more than others
- **It demonstrates a lack of commitment to the cause** - It can be interpreted as a lack of enthusiasm or dedication to the task or project at hand
- **It implies disorganization** - It indicates poor time management and planning skills

Once I recognized these implications, I began to be more punctual for meetings. I never want any of these labels attached to me, and I'm sure others wouldn't either. Everyone aspires to grow in their career, and if they exhibit these traits, I doubt their career growth trajectory can be very steep.

A simple piece of unsolicited advice I'd offer to anyone is to aim to arrive at meetings 10-15 minutes early. Once you reset your internal clock this way, you'll automatically start being on time for meetings and become more punctual overall.

Another effective strategy is to plan your day or week in advance. I've been doing this for the past 4-5 months and have seen positive results. Try to schedule everything in advance so you always know what you need to do. Trust me, it will significantly simplify your life.

Please look into yourself and try to identify if you are one of those? If so, now is the time to make a change.
